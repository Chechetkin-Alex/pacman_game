**Q:** What is this project about?  
**A:** This project is a game from students who are a little tired of deadlines, who are trying to survive at MIPT. The game is a kind of analogue of Pacman (at this iteration - a sort of a copy, but made with our own hands and with love), but we added some interesting features.

**Q:** What are the rules of the game?  
**A:** We think that they don't have to be explained, because the game is pretty famous. But in general, you need to collect all the points on the level, while not being eaten by a monster. Use left, right, up and down arrows to make the pacman head towards the right way.

**Q:** What language is the project written in?  
**A:** The project is written in python.

**Q:** What frameworks were used in the project?  
**A:** Only one framework was used - pygame.

**Q:** What are you planning to do in the future?  
**A:** We want to expand the range of "special" points on the map, give the players an opportunity to choose skins, make a small window at the bottom where information useful to the player will be displayed, change the appearances of the game characters and, most important, a multi-player game.

**Q:** In which branch of the repository does everything located?  
**A:** checkpoint_2

**Q:** What I need to install for the stable operation of the project?  
**A:** pygame 2.0.1 (Python 3.7.0)
