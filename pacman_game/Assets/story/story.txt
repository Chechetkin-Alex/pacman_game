    A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far awayâ€¦

    Have you ever wondered what happens to innocent Amogus who are thrown overboard by mistake?
    Amogus was a small, green creature who had always been fascinated by space travel. So, when he was given the opportunity to join a team of scientists on a mission to explore a distant planet, he jumped at the chance.
    But then, something went wrong. Our hero regularly performed tasks, but at one point he was considered a traitor and thrown off the ship. He tumbled through space, tumbling and spinning until he landed on a strange planet below.
    As he explored the planet's surface, he began to feel a sense of unease. Something was watching him.
    That's when he saw them - the Pacmen. These weren't the friendly characters he had seen in video games. They were pieces of cheese with mold, but somehow, they had gained intelligence. And they were chasing him.
    They drove him into the maze system to finish him off. But our hero was not so simple, so he turns on Forrest Gump mode and tries his best to survive :)
